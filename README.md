# THIS IS OBSOLETE

This repo contains a prototype 2017. It was succesful in demonstrating the basic principles and spawned a [successor project](http://annif.org) ([new github repo](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif)) but the code in this repo is not maintained anymore.

# Dependencies

* Elasticsearch installed on localhost

* Python modules: (virtualenv recommended, with pypy for extra speed)

  pip install requests
  pip install SPARQLWrapper
  pip install langdetect
  pip install elasticsearch
